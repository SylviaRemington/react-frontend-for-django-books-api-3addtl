# Project 4 Frontend Starter Code

This starter code is a react application that can be used as the starting point. It is designed to work with the following authentication flow:

## üîê Authentication

This API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.

### Register

```bash
POST /api/auth/register/
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "username": "johndoe",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "profile_image": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
  "password": "securepassword123",
  "password_confirmation": "securepassword123"
}
```

### Login

```bash
POST /api/auth/login/
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "securepassword123"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGc...",
  "message": "Welcome back johndoe"
}
```

### Get User

```bash
GET /api/auth/user/
Content-Type: application/json
```

Response:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "username": "johndoe",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "profile_image": "https://example.com/image.jpg"
}
```

Response:

Before using this starter code, you need to make sure your django application has an endpoint which will return the user.

To do this, add a UserView to your `authentication/views.py`

```python
class UserView(APIView):
    permission_classes = (IsAuthenticated, )

    def get(self, request):
        serialized_user = UserSerializer(request.user)
        return Response(serialized_user.data, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)
```

and then update your `authentication/urls.py` to include an endpoint to call

```python
from django.urls import path
from .views import RegisterView, LoginView, UserView

urlpatterns = [
    path('register/', RegisterView.as_view()),
    path('login/', LoginView.as_view()),
    path('user/', UserView.as_view()),
]
```

This will be important for being able to use the user context in our react app.

# Start

Setup: Create the .env and add the following text to it:

```plaintext
VITE_BACK_END_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
```

1. Add the books service

2. Display all the books

3. (optional) Create the protected route

4. Create the add book route

- you'll need to call the authors from the API to be able to reliably add a valid authors ID as the author on a book, so you'll need to create an authorsService

5. Create book show page

(remember to make list in dashboard clickable)

6. Add edit and delete functionality (remember to add to the service)
   you might want to add `request.data["owner"] = book_to_update.owner.id` to the update book function in django so user doesn't have to send their own ID from the frontend app

7. axios config to services to send request with token by default, allowing developer to remove repetitive headers in each request
